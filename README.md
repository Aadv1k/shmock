# Schmock 

Schmock is a RestAPI mocking service that tries to combine the best aspects of many similar services, such as [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) and [Mockend](https://mockend.com/)

- An optional YAML-based DSL for defining response schemas.
- The ability to specify multiple endpoints, each with its own header, query, and (post) body rules.
- Customizable global error schema.
- The flexibility to choose between a free-to-use API service or a self-hostable server.
